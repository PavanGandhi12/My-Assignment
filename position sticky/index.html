      <p>
        Always pushing to the limit and in search of the ideal line, you've got
        205 HP beneath you. Unbridled power pushes your RR to the max - with a
        maximum torque of 83 lb-ft at 11,000 rpm and a torque curve of at least
        74 lb-ft over a range of 5,500 to 14,500 rpm. Ten years after the first
        generation of the RR first mesmerized the world of motorcycles, we're
        now entering the next level of performance. We have updated almost every
        component of the RR - from the front to the rear. The result: less
        weight and noticeably higher performance. Are you ready for the pole
        position – are you ready to #NeverStopChallenging? The RR awaits you.

        Anyone who looks at it immediately understands that this is a high
        performance motorcycle. Every part of the RR has been designed to get
        the most out of it. Take, for instance, the frame layout with its new
        suspension technology that makes the RR lighter and more precise. In
        addition, there is the ergonomically focused seating position, which is
        unrivaled thanks to the modified frame and fairing design. The standard
        LED headlights give the bike a dynamic and aggressive look. The front
        indicators have moved from the fairing to the rearview mirrors, which
        not only looks aesthetically pleasing, but it also provides improved
        visibility. Seen from the rear, the RR dominates in terms of design and
        functionality: "All-in-one" is the motto here. In addition to license
        plate lighting, the license plate bracket now also includes LED turn
        signals, tail lights and brake lights. 1 / 4 Ready for the track. When
        it comes to top performance, the RR is your perfect partner. And not
        just on the road, but also on the track. In a few simple steps, you can
        dismantle both the rearview mirror and the license plate bracket and
        you've got a racing bike. The optionally available M Package turns your
        RR into the ultimate racing machine. Here the weight is once more
        reduced by around 7.7 lbs down to a mere 427 lbs. In addition to the
        Motorsport finish, the M carbon wheels, the M battery, the M seat with M
        passenger seat cover and the M swing arm pivot you also get Ride Modes
        Pro with the configurable Ride Modes Race Pro 1-3 and electronic
        assistance systems, such as DTC +/- Shift, ABS Settings, engine
        mappings, wheelie control and slide control and a whole lot more.

        engine of the RR Four cylinders and unrivaled performance. The
        redesigned four-cylinder engine is the RR power train. Not only was the
        peak output increased to 205 HP at 13,000 rpm, but the torque curve was
        also optimized. Thanks to BMW ShiftCam technology, which selects the
        valve opening time and the valve lift by means of the camshaft,
        significantly more torque and power is applied even in low and medium
        engine speed ranges. In addition, numerous other components were adapted
        to further optimize weight, space and design. These include a new timing
        concept, hollow-drilled titanium intake valves and an improved and
        self-reinforcing multi-disc, anti-hopping wet clutch (-20N). The engine
        is now narrower and about 9 lbs lighter, which improves both the
        handling and the ergonomics. You will notice this immediately when you
        first get on. EXPERIENCE THE RACING SOUND OF THE RR. SoundSTART ENGINE

        maximum performance in every situation. The RR is a technical high-flyer
        with road grip: The four standard modes RAIN, ROAD, DYNAMIC and RACE
        already cover numerous riding styles in a variety of conditions.
        Optional Ride Modes Pro mode lays the racing world at your feet with the
        three additional modes RACE Pro 1, RACE Pro 2 and RACE Pro 3, with
        Launch Control, Pitlane Limiter, HSC Pro (Hill Start Control Pro) and
        DBC (Dynamic Brake Control). With the multi-controller you can configure
        the following settings via the full-color 6.5" TFT display: the throttle
        response incl. engine characteristics, the engine braking torque, the
        traction control (DTC) incl. wheelie control, ABS and DDC (Dynamic
        Damping Control). And with the push of a button you can adjust the
        settings while riding via DTC +/- Shift. Thanks to the latest 6-axis
        sensor technology and torque precontrol, DTC support is particularly
        smooth and powerful, and performs no matter the gear, speed and
        inclination. With the next-generation DTC, you get more efficient,
        powerful and safer traction control and thus even more forward momentum.
        Rider on the BMW RR on the circuit More stability and better force
        application. The newest version RR has, as the only street-legal
        standard superbike, an aluminum undercarriage, which had previously only
        been used on the racing scene. The 0.66 lb lighter weight significantly
        reduces the unsprung mass and results in significantly less reaction
        from the chassis when accelerating. In addition, the shock absorber,
        which can be adjusted in terms of tension and rebound as well as the
        suspension, is installed farther away from the engine and is thus less
        exposed to heat. This has significant advantages for the shock absorber.
        By changing the strut ratio from 1.9:1 to 1.65:1 and having a larger
        damper piston, a smaller spring rate was able to be selected. This
        friction minimization increases comfort and performance since the power
        build-up in the strut occurs quickly and accurately. The entire system
        is thus much gentler on the tires. Female rider on a BMW RR superbike in
        Racing red Perfect damping on all routes. Dynamic Damping Control (DDC)
        showcases a recently developed control philosophy of the electronic
        chassis and mechanical damping component. Regardless of whether you're
        on a country road or the track - the electronic valve always provides
        the maximum damping, depending on the riding mode and purpose. It is now
        parallel to the mechanical valve. If necessary, the damping is reduced
        or increased in 10 milliseconds via this bypass line. The anodized
        floating piston rod is extremely sensitive. If required, the Shim
        Package can also be adapted by chassis specialists. The fork is also
        controlled by means of a linear position sensor with DDC. Damping is
        regulated here globally and in traction and compression stages. The
        suspension can be manually varied as needed. DATA & EQUIPMENT We see an
        S 1000 RR motorcycle Performance you can see. The RR doesn't shy away
        from a challenge. This is not only evident from its sporty design, but
        also the technology that's inside. STRONG APPEARANCE ON THE STREET.
